*mu4e Dahsboard*

mu4e dahsboard provides a new =mu4e= org link type that allows to execute
various mu4e queries when clicked. Such links can be organised into a
dashboard, by simply writing an org file as shown below:

[[./dashboard.png]]

Syntax is quite intuitive:

#+begin_src org
[[mu4e:query|format|count][description]]
#+end_src

=query= must be a valid mu4e query and =count= (optional) is the maxmimum
number of results to be returned. When the link is clicked,
=mu4e-headers-search= is called with the proper query.

#+begin_src org
[[mu4e:flag:unread][All unread]]
[[mu4e:flag:unread||10][Last 10 unread]]
#+end_src

=format= can be used to specify that =query= results are to be counted in
order to update the descritption using the given format:

#+begin_src org
[[mu4e:flag:unread|(%3d)][(---)]]
#+end_src

With the example above, when the link is cliked, the =---= part will be
replaced by the number of unread mails.
