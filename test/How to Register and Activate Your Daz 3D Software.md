## Step 1: Find Your Serial Key
 
The serial key is a combination of letters and numbers that is used to verify your purchase and unlock the full version of your software. Depending on where you got your software from, you may have received the serial key in an email, a text file, or a website. Make sure you copy or write down the serial key exactly as it is shown, including the hyphens.
 
## Step 2: Install Your Software
 
Once you have your serial key, you need to install your software on your computer. You can use the installer files that came with your download, or you can download them from the [Daz Install Manager](https://www.daz3d.com/install-manager-info) or the [Product Library](https://www.daz3d.com/product-library) on the Daz 3D website. To use the Install Manager or the Product Library, you need to create a free account on Daz 3D and log in with your email and password.
 
## Step 3: Enter Your Serial Key
 
After installing your software, you need to enter your serial key to activate it. The method of entering the serial key may vary depending on the software. For example, for Daz Studio, you need to launch the software and go to **Help > Register Daz Studio**. For Bryce, you need to launch the software and wait for a pop-up screen that asks for your name and serial key. For Hexagon, you need to launch the software and go to **Help > Enter Serial Number**. For Darkside, you need to launch the software and go to **Help > About Darkside** and click on **Register**.
 
When entering your serial key, make sure you type it exactly as it is shown, including the hyphens. If you enter it correctly, you should see a confirmation message that says your software is activated.
